Description: Material Design theme for MkDocs
 Create a branded static site from a set of Markdown files to host the
 documentation of your Open Source or commercial project – customizable,
 searchable, mobile-friendly, 40+ languages. Set up in 5 minutes.
 .
 Features:
 .
   * It's just Markdown — write your technical documentation in plain Markdown –
     no need to know HTML, JavaScript, or CSS. Material for MkDocs will do the
     heavy lifting and convert your writing to a beautiful and functional
     website.
 .
   * Responsive by design — built from the ground up to work on all sorts of
     devices – from mobile phones to widescreens. The underlying fluid layout
     will always adapt perfectly to the available screen space.
 .
   * Static, yet searchable — almost magically, your technical documentation
     website will be searchable without any further ado. Material for MkDocs
     comes with built-in search – no server needed – that will instantly answer
     your users' queries.
 .
   * Many configuration options — change the color palette, font families,
     language, icons, favicon and logo. Add a source repository link, links to
     your social profiles, Google Analytics and Disqus - all with a few lines of
     code.
 .
   * Truly international — thanks to many contributors, Material for MkDocs
     includes translations for more than 40 languages and offers full native RTL
     uright-to-left) support for languages such as Arabic, Persian (Farsi) and
     Hebrew.
 .
   * Accessible — Material for MkDocs provides extensible keyboard navigation
     and  semantic markup including role attributes and landmarks. Furthermore,
     the layout is entirely based on rem values, respecting the user's default
     font size.
 .
   * Beyond GitHub Markdown — integrates natively with Python Markdown
     Extensions, offering additional elements like callouts, tabbed content
     containers, mathematical formulas, critic markup, task lists, and emojis.
 .
   * Modern architecture — Material for MkDocs's underlying codebase is built
     with TypeScript, RxJS, and SCSS, and is compiled with Webpack, bringing
     excellent possibilities for theme extension and customization.
